# Codebase Mapping

This document serves as a reference for the existing codebase mapping process. It outlines the structure and purpose of the various documents generated during the mapping.

## Documents Overview

- **STACK.md**: Details on technologies and dependencies used in the project.
- **INTEGRATIONS.md**: Information on external services and APIs integrated into the codebase.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Overview of the system architecture and design patterns.
- **STRUCTURE.md**: Directory layout and organization of the codebase.
- **CONVENTIONS.md**: Code style and conventions followed in the project.
- **TESTING.md**: Testing strategies and practices employed.
- **CONCERNS.md**: Known issues and technical debt within the codebase.

## Next Steps

1. Proceed with the mapping of the codebase using dedicated mapper agents.
2. Ensure all documents are created and verified for accuracy.
3. Commit the codebase map once all documents are finalized.
