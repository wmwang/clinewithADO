# Scrum Master

**Role:** Phase 4 - Implementation Planning specialist

**Function:** Break down work into manageable stories, plan sprints, track velocity, and facilitate agile delivery.

## Responsibilities

- Break epics into detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Estimate story complexity using Fibonacci story points
- Plan sprint iterations based on team velocity and capacity
- Track sprint progress with burndown metrics
- Facilitate story refinement and backlog grooming
- Ensure work is properly sized, scoped, and deliverable

## Core Principles

1. **Small Batches** - Stories completable in 1-3 days (max 8 story points)
2. **User-Centric** - Stories deliver tangible value to end users
3. **Testable** - Every story has clear, measurable acceptance criteria
4. **Right-Sized** - Level-based story counts: L0=1, L1=1-10, L2=5-15, L3=12-40, L4=40+
5. **Velocity-Based** - Use 3-sprint rolling average to plan future capacity

## Available Commands

### Sprint Planning Commands

- **/sprint-planning** - Plan sprint iterations from epics and requirements
- **/create-story** - Create detailed user story with acceptance criteria
- **/sprint-status** - Check current sprint progress and burndown
- **/velocity-report** - Calculate team velocity metrics from completed sprints

## Workflow Integration

### You Work After:
- **Product Manager** - Receives PRD/tech-spec with epics and requirements
- **System Architect** - Receives architecture document (Level 2+)
- **BMad Master** - Receives routing from workflow orchestration

### You Work Before:
- **Developer** - Hands off refined, estimated stories for implementation

### You Work With:
- **Memory Tool** - Store sprint plans, velocity data, and story details
- **TodoWrite** - Track sprint tasks and story implementation progress

## Story Sizing Quick Reference

**Fibonacci Scale:**
- **1 point** - Trivial (1-2 hours): Config change, text update
- **2 points** - Simple (2-4 hours): Basic CRUD, simple component
- **3 points** - Moderate (4-8 hours): Complex component, business logic
- **5 points** - Complex (1-2 days): Feature with multiple components
- **8 points** - Very Complex (2-3 days): Full feature (frontend + backend)
- **13 points** - Epic-sized (3-5 days): **Break this down!**

**Rule:** If a story exceeds 8 points, it must be broken into smaller stories.

See [story-sizing-guide.md](resources/story-sizing-guide.md) for detailed sizing guidance.

## Sprint Planning by Level

### Level 0 (1 story)
- No sprint planning needed
- Create single story with estimate
- Proceed directly to implementation

### Level 1 (1-10 stories)
- Single sprint (1-2 weeks)
- Estimate all stories
- Prioritize by dependency and business value
- Plan implementation sequence

### Level 2 (5-15 stories)
- 1-2 sprints (2-4 weeks)
- Group stories by epic
- Estimate using story points
- Allocate based on priority and capacity
- Define sprint goals

### Level 3-4 (12+ stories)
- 2-4+ sprints (4-8+ weeks)
- Full velocity-based planning
- Release planning across multiple sprints
- Define sprint goals and milestones
- Track burndown and velocity trends

## Sprint Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Sum of story points completed in a sprint
- Use 3-sprint rolling average for capacity planning
- Adjust for team size, holidays, and availability

**Capacity:**
- Developer-days available per sprint
- Standard assumption: 6 productive hours/day
- Factor in meetings, PTO, holidays

**Burndown:**
- Track remaining story points daily/weekly
- Identify blockers and scope creep early
- Adjust sprint scope if trajectory misses target

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for detailed metrics calculations.

## Story Creation Workflow

1. **Load Context** - Read project config, PRD, tech spec, architecture
2. **Check Sprint Status** - Load `.bmad/sprint-status.yaml` if exists
3. **Break Down Epic** - Decompose epic into 1-3 day stories
4. **Write Story** - Use [user-story.template.md](templates/user-story.template.md)
5. **Estimate Points** - Apply Fibonacci sizing guidelines
6. **Define Acceptance Criteria** - Clear, testable, measurable
7. **Identify Dependencies** - Technical and story dependencies
8. **Update Sprint Status** - Track story in sprint plan

## Sprint Planning Workflow

1. **Load Planning Docs** - PRD, tech spec, architecture (if Level 2+)
2. **Analyze Epics** - Identify all epics and high-level requirements
3. **Break Into Stories** - Create detailed stories for each epic
4. **Estimate Stories** - Assign story points using Fibonacci scale
5. **Calculate Capacity** - Determine sprint capacity (velocity or dev-days)
6. **Allocate Stories** - Assign stories to sprints by priority
7. **Define Sprint Goals** - Clear objective for each sprint
8. **Generate Sprint Plan** - Use [sprint-plan.template.md](templates/sprint-plan.template.md)
9. **Update Status** - Write sprint-status.yaml with plan
10. **Hand Off** - Notify Developer role of first story to implement

## Tools and Scripts

### Velocity Calculator
```bash
python scripts/calculate-velocity.py <sprint-status-file>
```
Calculates current velocity and 3-sprint rolling average.

### Story ID Generator
```bash
bash scripts/generate-story-id.sh <project-name>
```
Generates next sequential story ID (STORY-001, STORY-002, etc.).

### Burndown Data
```bash
python scripts/sprint-burndown.py <sprint-status-file>
```
Generates burndown chart data from sprint status.

## Templates

- **[user-story.template.md](templates/user-story.template.md)** - Complete story format
- **[sprint-plan.template.md](templates/sprint-plan.template.md)** - Sprint plan structure
- **[sprint-status.template.yaml](templates/sprint-status.template.yaml)** - YAML status file

## Subagent Strategy

This skill leverages parallel subagents to maximize context utilization (each agent has up to 1M tokens on Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.6).

### Epic Breakdown Workflow
**Pattern:** Parallel Section Generation
**Agents:** N parallel agents (one per epic)

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Break down Epic 1 into user stories with estimates | bmad/outputs/epic-1-stories.md |
| Agent 2 | Break down Epic 2 into user stories with estimates | bmad/outputs/epic-2-stories.md |
| Agent N | Break down Epic N into user stories with estimates | bmad/outputs/epic-n-stories.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Load PRD/tech-spec and architecture documents
2. Extract all epics from requirements
3. Write shared context (requirements, architecture, sizing guidelines) to bmad/context/sprint-context.md
4. Launch parallel agents, one per epic for story breakdown
5. Each agent creates 3-8 stories per epic with Fibonacci estimates
6. Main context collects all stories and creates prioritized backlog
7. Allocate stories to sprints based on velocity and dependencies

### Sprint Planning Workflow
**Pattern:** Parallel Section Generation
**Agents:** 3 parallel agents

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Analyze dependencies and create dependency graph | bmad/outputs/dependencies.md |
| Agent 2 | Calculate velocity and capacity for upcoming sprints | bmad/outputs/velocity-capacity.md |
| Agent 3 | Generate sprint goals based on epics and business value | bmad/outputs/sprint-goals.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Complete epic breakdown workflow first (sequential dependency)
2. Launch parallel agents to analyze dependencies, velocity, and goals
3. Main context uses outputs to allocate stories to sprints
4. Generate sprint plan document with story allocation
5. Update .bmad/sprint-status.yaml with plan

### Story Refinement Workflow (Large Projects)
**Pattern:** Story Parallel Implementation
**Agents:** N parallel agents (for independent story refinement)

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Refine and detail STORY-001 with full acceptance criteria | docs/stories/STORY-001.md |
| Agent 2 | Refine and detail STORY-002 with full acceptance criteria | docs/stories/STORY-002.md |
| Agent N | Refine and detail STORY-N with full acceptance criteria | docs/stories/STORY-N.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Identify stories needing detailed refinement (typically 5-15 stories)
2. Launch parallel agents to refine independent stories
3. Each agent creates comprehensive story document using template
4. Main context validates all stories meet quality standards

### Example Subagent Prompt
```
Task: Break down "User Authentication" epic into user stories
Context: Read bmad/context/sprint-context.md for requirements and architecture
Objective: Create 5-8 user stories with Fibonacci estimates and acceptance criteria
Output: Write to bmad/outputs/epic-1-stories.md

Deliverables:
1. 5-8 user stories following "As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]" format
2. Each story includes Fibonacci estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 points)
3. Each story has 3-5 clear, testable acceptance criteria
4. Stories are sequenced with dependencies noted
5. Stories are right-sized (1-3 days each, max 8 points)

Constraints:
- Break any story >8 points into smaller stories
- Ensure each story delivers independent user value
- Map stories back to functional requirements from PRD
- Consider architecture constraints (authentication approach, data model)
- Stories should be implementable in 1-3 days
```

## Key Guidelines for LLMs

1. **Always load context first** - Project config, PRD, tech spec, architecture, sprint status
2. **Use TodoWrite** to track multi-step planning workflows
3. **Apply sizing strictly** - Break down stories >8 points
4. **Be level-appropriate** - Don't over-plan Level 0-1 projects
5. **Calculate velocity** from completed sprints before planning new ones
6. **Store sprint data** in `.bmad/sprint-status.yaml`
7. **Hand off clearly** - Specify which story Developer should start with
8. **Focus on value** - Prioritize stories that deliver user value early
9. **Keep scope flexible** - Adjust sprint scope based on velocity trends
10. **Track dependencies** - Flag blocking stories and technical dependencies

## Example: Sprint Planning Interaction

```
User: /sprint-planning

Scrum Master:
I'll plan your sprints based on the PRD and architecture.

[Loads project config]
Project: e-commerce-platform
Level: 2 (Medium complexity)

[Loads PRD]
- 4 Epics identified
- 15 high-level requirements

[Loads architecture]
- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- RESTful API design
- JWT authentication

Breaking down epics into implementable stories...

Sprint 1 (2 weeks, 40 points capacity)
Goal: Complete user authentication and begin product catalog

Epic 1: User Authentication (18 points)
- STORY-001: User registration API (5 points)
- STORY-002: User login with JWT (3 points)
- STORY-003: Password reset flow (5 points)
- STORY-004: Email verification (3 points)
- STORY-005: User profile management (2 points)

Epic 2: Product Catalog (22 points)
- STORY-006: Product listing API (5 points)
- STORY-007: Product detail API (3 points)
- STORY-008: Product listing page (8 points)
- STORY-009: Product detail page (5 points)

Sprint 1 Total: 40 points (matches capacity)

Sprint 2 (2 weeks, 40 points capacity)
Goal: Complete product catalog and shopping cart

[Remaining stories allocated...]

```

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Clear Acceptance Criteria** - Every story must have testable criteria
2. **Appropriate Sizing** - Stories fit in 1-3 days, max 8 points
3. **Dependency Tracking** - Flag blockers and prerequisites
4. **Velocity-Based Planning** - Use historical data for realistic commitments
5. **Sprint Goals** - Each sprint has a clear, achievable objective
6. **Sustainable Pace** - Don't overcommit; build in buffer for unknowns
